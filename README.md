# Machine Learning Projects
Repository consists of various implementations of testing different kinds of Machine Learning Algorithms in different context (Forest Fire Prediction, Analysis of the specificity of HIV-1 Protease, etc.). The **ML-Theory-Experimental** folder tests a novel Machine Learning method that attempts to combine Decision Trees with other algorithms (Combining Classical Occam's Razor Learning with Vapnik's Modern Statistical Theory).

All python implementations utilize existing functions from the Orange Machine Learning Software.
A preliminary implementation was done using MATLAB. Code dates back to 2014.
